Retro Snake game in Javascript!

## As it is made in JavaScript it can be run in a browser and works very well, You will need some basic javascript knowledge beforehand !

## Canvas elements.
Draw the snake’s body and the snake’s food. Remember that the snake is a chain of squares,
therefore we will draw only one square which will 
be repeated inside the snake array. 


## The snake and food structures.
Now create the structure of the snake. Our snake is an empty array in which
we will push every element of the chain which will be the snake’s body.

## Collision with the snake’s body.
Create a checkCollision function to detect if the snake has crashed on its body itself.

## KeyCode controls.
We are almost there! But we need the keys controls to move the snake up, down, left and
right. We can use the onkeydown event which occurs when the player is pressing a key.
We will use only the arrows of the keyboard, with the corresponding key code values 37, 38, 39 and 40.


> Your game is finished and I hope that my explanation has been clear enough. Now you can play and make a great score!
